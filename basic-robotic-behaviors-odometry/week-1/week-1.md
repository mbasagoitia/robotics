# What is a Robot?

A robot is an autonomous machine capable of sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and performing actions in the real world outside of its body.

A physically-embodied, artificially intelligent agent that is capable of sensing, planning, and affecting the physical world.

Important concepts:

- Sensing the environment
- Able to perform computations
- Performs actions

## Collaborative Robots

New features of collaborative robots include 

- Sensing/perception: tactile/force sensing, visual sensing
- Safety systems: force cut-off, human awareness
- Safe programming environment: still simple "keyframing" - no new intelligence

As of now, only very few of the currently deployed robotic systems are collaborative (vs traditional industrial robots)

## Service Robots

New, fast-growing class of robots used in warehousing, logistics, cleaning, medical applications, hospitality, etc.

## Frontiers of Robotics Research

- Balance and dynamic mobility
    - Ability to traverse all terrain, access all areas

- Mobile and in-hand manipulation
    - Extend the range and capability of manipulators

- Mobile perception
    - Perform localization, inform decision-making

- Intelligent reasoning
    - Leverage common-sense from language-based models
    - Translating human commands to robotic motions
