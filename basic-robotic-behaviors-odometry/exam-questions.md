Electric motors rely on a combination of permanent magnets and coils in which a magnetic field is induced by electric current. What are possible ways to generate a change in the electric field that actually makes the motor turn?


The motor can be operated by "alternating current" (AC), which limits the rotational speed to the frequency of the current. 

Correct
This is correct. As this makes it very difficult to change speed, this approach is only used in heavy machinery. 

Provided with a sensor to estimate the position of the coil, one can use fast power electronics to switch the polarity of the current just in time. 

Correct
Yes. This is known as a "brushless DC motor".

Thinking about what you just learned about the DC motor and the stepper motor, what could be the drawback of a stepper motor? 

Stepper motors require multiple strong coils, making the stepper motor much bulkier as a DC motor.

Correct
Yes. Being bulkier is not their only drawback, however, they are usually also much more expensive than a DC motor.
